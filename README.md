# 1Chan

## Overview
1chan is my attempt at trying to build an anonymous textboard forum in the spirit of 4chan. It uses the Django Web Framework and PostgreSQL for the database. I learned a ton while working on this project and gave me a deeper understanding of how one of my favorite websites work.
