# 1Chan

## Overview
1chan is my attempt at trying to build an anonymous textboard forum in the spirit of 4chan. It uses the Django Web Framework and PostgreSQL for the database. I learned a ton while working on this project and gave me a deeper understanding of how one of my favorite websites work. It was also a really nice challenge for me personally because I have always thought that these websites that I use everyday where so complicated. But, they all started will simple and getting the basic components done for the site doesn't take that long. Really, everyone can do it.

## What I've learned
For this project, I have improved my web design skills using Bootstrap and Django widget tweaks. I have also learned how to set up a different database with Django. I've also stenghthen my understanding of Django's template language used in html files. I've had to used these a lot for this project. I've also implemented pagination using Django which I had never done before. I've used model forms instead of creating everything from scratch. I've also learned how to manage multiple forms on the same page. I've also learned more about model fields and url patterns.

## Improvements
As always, there are improvements that can be done to this project. Even though I have done better with the web design of this project, it still needs a lot of improvement. The code in views.py needs to be cleaned up a lot as well.For the views, maybe I can use class-based views instead of function-based views. The code would also need more documentation.
